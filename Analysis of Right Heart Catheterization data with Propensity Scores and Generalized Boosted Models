**The mean ASAM is 0,05699, which is larger than 0.02, therefore our ASAM is too high.**
**In the plot of Absolute standard difference we can that after weighting the maximum ASMD decreases for most pretreatment covariates. However, we can also see that the ASMD increases for a few pretreatment covariates. All of these differences are statistically significant, as indicated by the solid red cirles.**
**In the boxplot of estimated Ps for the treatment group, we can see that there is little overlap, meaning our causal inference estimate will not be accurate.**

**The coefficient estimate the causal treatment effect of RHC, assuming there are no unobserved confounders, is 0.1130. In this data, we are unable to detect differences in the treatment group means for RHC. The data do not suggest a significant difference in death in 30 days between those who recieved RHC and those who did not.**
